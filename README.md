# ringMyBell
Very simple script that rings after a specified amount of time.


Please call this script like this:

	./alarmAfter timeinSeconds
 or 
	./alarmAfter timeInMinutes+m. 

In fact, you can call it with any input the "sleep" function can take. 
Examples: 
./alarmAfter 180 
./alarmAfter 3m

Make sure you're allowed to excecute the script ;-) (chmod +x alarmAfter)
